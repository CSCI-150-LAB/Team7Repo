                    <p>This website allows students to give feedback as a class is happening on different learning and teaching styles and any other feedback they feel is important either anonymously or not.  Professors and administrators can create profiles, organize students into classes, conduct feedback sessions, and view their students' feedback.  Administrators also have total control over professors and can moderate feedback, feedback sessions, and classes.</p>

                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>The idea of this project came from a couple of students who have both taught children and taken classes from professors.  They realized that having real-time feedback about how well the students are comprehending that can be anonoymous or not would help both students and teachers be more effective.</p>
