Registration Page:

This page applies to all new users, Admin, Instructors, and Students alike. It will prompt the users for information
and will then store the responses in the central database for future logins.

The form asks for the following information from the users: 

	- First Name
	- Last Name
	- Email (school/work email, e.g., example[at]mail.fresnostate.edu)
	- Password
	- ID Number
	- Role at Institution (i.e., Admin, Instructor, Student)

All of these fields are required to be filled out.

Each of these (except for the Role at Institution) have extra entry requirements. For the first and last name, only letters
and whitespace are allowed. Any special characters or numbers in these fields will prompt an error message to re-enter their
information. The email must be entered in the proper format with the domain being either 'csufresno.edu' or 
'mail.fresnostate.edu' to ensure only school/work emails are being used. If this is not the case with the user's input, an 
error message will pop up to correct the entry. The requirements for the password are that it must be: between 8 - 16 characters 
long, contain at least one uppercase letter, at least one lowercase letter, at least one number, and at least one special 
character. The ID Number entered must only consist of numbers. If any letter or special character is found in the entry, an
error message will display. Once the data is entered without error, the database will store each attribute in the table housing
the user login information. 

For specific descriptions on what each part of the program is doing, refer to the comments in RegistrationPage.PHP .

NOTE: For security, '$_POST' is used over '$_GET' and any entered data is converted to HTML characters to avoid 
attacks (e.g., malicious text insertions).
