# Instructor User

This page details the features that Instructor users will interact with in FeedbackLoop.

Instructor Profile:
The instructor profile page details information about an instructor user that is available to any user on the website.  Information includes:
    - Preferred Title (Dr., Professor, Mr., Mrs., Ms.)
    - First Name and Last Name
    - Department
    - Email Address
    - Amount of Usage of each Learning Style (Visual, Auditory, Reading/Writing, Kinesthetic)

If the instructor is logged in and is currently viewing their own profile, an Edit Profile button will appear.  On this page, the instructor can edit the values of the information on their profile as stated above excluding their First Name and Last Name, and Email Address.

Instructor Dashboard:
On this page, instructors can see information about their classes displayed in a tabular format.  All classes the instructor has created will appear in the table along with the following information:
    - Class Name (ex. CSCI 150)
    - Class Description (ex. Software Engineering)
    - Dates and Times of the Class
    - Rating from the class's students

On this page, there is also a button, Create a Section, which allows the instructor to create a new class or section.  On this page, the instructor will need to enter the above information excluding a rating.  The rating is a cumulative value from the students' ratings of the instructor throughout the class.

The Class Name values are links that the Instructor can click on to take them to a summary view of the information for the class.  The same information as stated above appears on the page, as well as a list of all the students' names and emails that are in the class.  The instructor can also click on an Add Student button to add a student to the class.  The button will take the instructor to a page that will say what class they are adding the student to.  The instructor can then add the email into the given box and submit the form to add the student.  The form uses the student's email because when registering, students can use a preferred name rather than their legal name, so a school email is more effective at finding the correct student.

Within each class, the students' names are links to the corresponding students' profile for the instructor to view.  More details on student profiles is provided in the Student User documentation.
